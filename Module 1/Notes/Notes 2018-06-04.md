## Submitting assignments
* Submit each Python file individually
* **Do not submit zips!**
* Don't need to add comments

```py
# Name
# Date
# Description
# Assignment
```

Example:

```py
# Aaron Bolyard
# 2018-06-04
# This program does nothing.
# AS1X

main():
	paas

if __name__ == '__main__':
	main()
```

## Docstrings

* 3x quotes (`"""Example"""`)
```py
"""
Performs foo.

Expects values in range of X.

Returns bar.
"""
```

## Files
**Format:** How data is written to a file or read from a file,
            and what fields it has.

* Operations on files:
	* Read (r): read from a file
	* Write (w): start with an empty file
	* Append (a): add to end of file
	* Don't forget R/W: read, and write, but file data remains

* `readline` to read an individua line
	* `for line in file:` works also
* `read` reads entire contents of file
* `readlines` into a list of lines
	* more memory than `for line in file` idiom if streaming is
	  possible
