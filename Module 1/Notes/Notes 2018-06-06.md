## Submitting assignments
* Show tutorials in class
* Pay attention to naming!
* HW 1 shouldn't have exception handling.

## Exception handling
* Prevents implementation from being exposed to user (useless)
* Using exception handling, programmer can respond to errors
  in a reasonable manner. For example, if the user fails to
  enter an integer, the user can be notified of the invalid
  input and asked for valid input.

```py
def get_integer(prompt, filter):
	line = input(prompt + " ")
	try:
		value = int(line)

		if filter != None and not filter(value):
			print("Input value not valid; please try again.")
			return get_integer(prompt, filter)

		return value
	except ValueError:
		print("Input not an integer; please try again.")
		return get_integer(prompt, filter)
```

* `int`, `float`, `str` try and parse argument. If parsing fails,
  throws a ValueError.
  * Parsing is the process in which text is converted to an object.
    For example, parsing an integer takes any series of digits (e.g., 0-9)
    and converts it to an integer primitive.

## Loops
* Use whatever loop makes sense.
* `while` loops are good for indeterminate (non-const) conditions such as looping until
  input is valid.
* `for` loops are good for determinate (e.g., const) conditions, such as looping until
  a number is reached.
* Recursion is a thing, too, but try not to use it. Can cause some hairy messes (stack
  overflow). 

## Homework logic
```pseudo
file = open("numbers.txt", "r")

total = 0
num_values = 0
line = file.readline()
while line != ""
	# Convert line to integer and sum it with total.
	total += int(line)
	# Keep track of how many values were read.
	num_values++

average = 0
if num_values > 0
	average = total / num_values
else:
	print("no input")

print("average", average)
```
