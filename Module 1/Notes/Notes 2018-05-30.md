# Module 1
* Go to python.org and get latest version (3.6.x)
* Anaconda (Python IDE), Visual Studio
* PyCharm!

* Use "main" pattern:
```
if __name__ == "__main__":
	main()
```
* This is to prevent running code when importing Python files
	* Allows easy code re-use

* Don't write code in shell (in IDLE)
	* Go to File -> New and make sure to save.

```
def printAverage(average):
	print("The average is", average)

def main():
	# This is a different scope than printAverage, thus although the names are the same,
	# the variables are different.
	average = 90
	printAverage(average)

	avg = 100
	printAverage(avg)
```

```
# Imports module X as 'X'
import X

# For example, imports math.
import math
print(math.sin(math.pi)) # Should print a value near 0

# Imports module 'Y' as 'X'
import X as Y

# For example, the temperature module will be imported as T
import T as temperature

# Imports member 'X' from module 'Y'
from X import Y

# For example...
from math import sin, pi
print(sin(pi)) # Should print a value near 0

```
