# 2018-06-09

## Lectures
* Classes on 6/9 and 6/11
* GUIs on 6/16 6/18
* 6/26 last day, no submissions after 2 pm
* Upcoming test will be 30 mins
* Test will be manipulating data from a file

## Classes
* Classes describe an object
* HumanBeing class
* When born, you are instianted and inherit everything from the HumanBeing class

* Things (attributes) you get as a HumanBeing

`
Picture of Stick Man
* Head
* Trunk/Body
* Arms
* Legs
`

* Methods:
  * walk
  * run
  * talk
  * wave

* When a class is instantiated it becomes an object
* Bob, Sue, and Sally are all objects (instances) of HumanBeings
* Any modifications to Bob are unique to Bob

To define a class, it's like a function, except no parenthesis and we use `class`
instead of `def`:

```py
class Product:
	def __init__(self, name, price, discountPercent):
		"""
		This is the constructor. When a new Product is instantiated,
		this method is called with the given arguments.

		self is a hidden/implicit parameter pointing to the instance. The other
		parameters are passed like normal.

		By prefixing fields with two underscores, only methods inside Product can
		modify them. Outside code cannot read or write to these fields.
		"""
		self.__name = name
		self.__price = price
		self.__discountPercent = discountPercent

	def getDiscountAmount(self):
		"""
		To get variables belonging to the instance, we use `self`.

		This method calculates the amount of the discount.
		"""
		return self.__price * (self.__discountPercent / 100)

	def getDiscountPrice():
		"""
		This method calculates the price after discount.
		"""
		return self.__price - self.getDiscountPrice()

	# In more advanced examples, gets and sets wrap fields (e.g., __name).
	# `get` would return a field, and `set` would mutate/change a variable.
	# By using `set`, you can enforce restraints; for example, making the discount between
	# 0 and 100.
```

If there are multiple classes in one file:

```py
from Register import Product
from Foo import Bar, Baz

# Now they would be used like so:
bar = Bar("hello")
bar = Foo.Bar("hello") # ERROR! Foo is not defined.
```

## GUIs & OOP
* Textbox class allows creating multiple Textbox objects (for example),
  each with their own text inputs
