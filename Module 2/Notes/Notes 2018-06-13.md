# 2018-06-11

## Assignments
* First test next Wednesday (2018/06/20).

* Showed off list exercises, reviewed list operations from
  previous class.

* Lists are mutable, and stored as references. Thus:

```py
foo = [ 1, 2, 3 ]
bar = foo
bar[0] = 99

print(foo) # [ 99, 2, 3 ]
print(bar) # [ 99, 2, 3 ]
```

* Use `copy` module to create a deep-copy of a list.

```py
# Slices list.
foo = [ 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e' ]
print(foo[1:3]) # Prints [ 'b, 'c' ]
print(foo[3:])  # Prints [ 'd', 'e' ]
print(foo[0::2])  # Prints [ 'a', 'c', 'e' ]

# Logic is:
array[start:stop:step]
# ...where...
# * start defaults to zero
# * stop defaults to len(array)
# * step defaults to 1
```

## Tuples
* Tuples are created with parenthesis instead of brackets

```py
value = ( 1, 2, 3 )
```

* Tuples are immutable; they cannot be modified.
