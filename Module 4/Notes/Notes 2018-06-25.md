Generate report:
* Hyphen between item category & item ID
* Optionally: include total sales & average sales

* The formatted report can just be strings.
* The report with average, etc must marshal strings to numbers.

```py
# String is fixed point: three whole digits + 2 decimal digitals (19700). Convert by dividing
# by 100.
price = int(priceString) / 100 
```

...

re-iteration of info from previous lecture

* Use last 3 digits for price

* Student report prints last name, first name, student ID, login ID, and student email
* Make sure to include your info (**but not my student ID, duh!**)

* Due Sunday (July 1) 

## Formatting

* `rjust` aligns text on right and prepends spaces
```py
value = "Hello"
print(value.rjust(10)) # "     Hello"
```

* `ljust` aligns text on left and appends spaces
```py
value = "Hello"
print(value.ljust(10)) # "Hello     "
```

* `center` centers the text, appending and prepending spaces

```py
value = "Hello"
print(value.center(11)) # "   Hello   "
```

* Use it to format fields

```py
firstName = "Bob"
lastName = "Smith"
studentID = "2851111"
# Bob       Smith     2851111"
print(firstName.ljust(10) + lastName.ljust(10) + studentID.ljust(7))
```
