## CSV

* CSV files handle arbitrary-length data better
	* Unlike fixed-width formats.

* Comma is the most common delimiter for a CSV file, but
  can use any delimiter (tab, space, etc).

* CSV files are small; smaller than equivalent Excel spreadsheet

* CSV files are clean and compatible across spreadsheet programs and
  other software.

```py
# CSV module.
import csv

# Create reader.
with open("names.csv") as file:
	reader = csv.reader(file)

	next(reader) # Advances to next row.
	# Useful if the first row of the CSV file has column descriptions.

	# 'line' is an array of strings.
	for line in reader:
		print(line) # ['Foo', 'Bar', 'Baz']
		print(line[1])  # 'Bar'

with open("names.csv") as file:
	reader = csv.DictReader(file)

	# Line is a dictionary of strings.
	for line in reader:
		print(line) # OrderedDict([('First_Name', 'Anthony'), ('Last_Name', 'Cameron'), ('Email', 'camerona6581@faytechcc.edu')])
```

### Aside
* DOS had a restriction of 8 characters for the filename and 3 for the
  extension. Hence, ".htm" and ".csv".

## Dictionaries
* Dictionaries a map: they have a key and a value.

```py
m = {
	# 'key' has 'value'.
	'key': 'value'
}

print(m['key']) # prints 'value'
print(m['foo']) # KeyError
```
